# ConcatenatingStrings
Please write a program that takes two strings from the user (as objects of the String type) and then concatenate these two strings, i.e., the first one adds to the second, and the second to the first - using the method provided by the String class.
In the next step, the program compares the concatenated Strings (also using the method provided by the String class) and checks if the composition of two different Strings is alternating.
